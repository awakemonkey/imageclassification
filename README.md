# Image Classification Prototype
## This code just present a prototpye of Image Classification model, which trained by using tensorflow, keras and CNN algorithm. <br>
### The database used in this case just a portion of original dataset, but the categories are still the same.
### If you want to use this code to train your own model, please remember to change the path of dataset, and also the category name.


## In order to present how the model can be used to optimize self-checking process, an interactive UI is designed to combine the model with a simple UI, <br>
## to give user a clear view how it will be operated in real world.
