# Image Classification Prototype
## This code just present a prototpye of Image Classification model, which trained by using tensorflow, keras and CNN algorithm. <br>
### The database used in this case is the original dataset from Fruit-360 on Kaggle, and the dataset maybe too large to run when training the model, so I only keep 13 items for prototype.
### If you want to use this code to train your own model, please remember to change the path of dataset, and also the category name.


## In order to present how the model can be used to optimize self-checking process, an interactive UI is designed to combine the model with a simple UI, to give user a clear view how it will be operated in real world.
